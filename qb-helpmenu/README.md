## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get QB-HelpMenu up and running on your server:

1.  ‚¨áÔ∏è **Download:** Place the `qb-helpmenu` folder into your server's `resources/[qb]` directory.

2.  üìä **Database:** Ensure you have `oxmysql` installed and configured. The script will automatically create the necessary `helpmenu_preferences` table on the first start if it doesn't exist.

3.  üåê **Locales:** The script uses locale files for translations. The default is `locales/en.lua`. Create new locale files (e.g., `locales/es.lua`, `locales/fr.lua`) for additional languages and add your translations.

4.  üìù **Configuration:** Edit `config.lua` to customize all aspects of the script. This is where you define language settings, help content, notifications, auto-show features, tips, commands, keybindings, and UI.

5.  ‚úÖ **Start Resource:** Add `ensure qb-helpmenu` to your `server.cfg`.

6.  üîÑ **Restart Server:** Restart your FiveM server to apply all changes.

4.  **Update `fxmanifest.lua`:** Open the `fxmanifest.lua` file for `qb-helpmenu` and add your new locale file to the `files` list.
5.  **Update `config.lua`:** Open `config.lua` and add your new language to the `Config.AvailableLanguages` table. Include its `code`, `name`, and an appropriate `flag` emoji.
6.  **Restart Server:** Restart your FiveM server for the new language to become available in-game.
